    "#Ans1. A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data. A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that enables users to create, modify, and access databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined through foreign keys. SQL databases are known for their ability to enforce data integrity through constraints, such as primary keys and unique indexes, and for their ability to handle complex queries involving multiple tables. Popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data that cannot be easily organized into tables. NoSQL databases are often used for web-scale applications, where performance and scalability are critical, and where data models may need to be updated frequently. NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document, graph, and column-family, to represent and store data. Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a table-based data model, while NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, graph, and column-family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema that defines the structure of the data, while NoSQL databases have a flexible schema that allows for easy changes to the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL as the query language, while NoSQL databases use various query languages, such as MongoDB's query language, Cassandra's CQL, and GraphQL for graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases typically scale vertically by adding more CPU, memory, and storage to a single server, while NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID compliance: SQL databases are often ACID-compliant, meaning they guarantee Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability of transactions, while NoSQL databases may sacrifice some of these properties for performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the data model, query patterns, scalability, and consistency requirements.\n",

    "#Ans5. In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in the table is unique. A primary key cannot contain null values, and each table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a customers table with columns for id, name, and email. The id column could be used as the primary key, as each customer should have a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key is used to establish a relationship between the two tables, allowing data to be retrieved from both tables based on the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a orders table with columns for id, customer_id, and total. The customer_id column could be used as a foreign key that refers to the id column in the customers table. This would allow us to retrieve data from both tables based on the relationship between orders and customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. Together, these keys are essential for establishing relationships between tables and enforcing data integrity in a relational database.\n",
